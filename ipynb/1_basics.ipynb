Google Colab notebook\n    2.  IDLE interactive shell\n    3.  `python` on the command line\n    4.  Console in replit.com or DataCamp workspace\n\n-   The code is available as [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/birkenkrahe/445237c66cb015ca243c3c5fe40f9888) and in the `ipynb` directory.\n\n"

        "-   What does the expression `str(int(age) + 1)` do?\n    1.  `age` is string `input`\n    2.  `int(age)` converts the string to a number - you cannot do that\n        with any character like \"a\": `int(\"a\")` throws an error. To convert\n        characters to their Unicode standard, you need to use `ord`:\n        \n            print(int(\"25\"))\n            print(ord(\"a\"))\n            print(ord(\"A\"))\n    3.  `int(age) + 1` adds 1 to whatever number `int(age)` evaluates to:\n        \n            age = \"25\"\n            print(age)\n            print(age + \" years old\")\n            print(int(age))\n            print(int(age)+1)\n    4.  `str(int(age) + 1)` converts the result to a string:\n        \n            age = \"25\"\n            print(age)\n            print(age + \" years old\")\n            print(int(age))\n            print(int(age)+1)\n            print(str(int(age)+1))\n            print(str(int(age)+1) + \" years old\")\n\n-   [Here is an HTML animation to illustrate these steps](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/eval/3-4.html) (Sweigart, 2023)\n\n-   `split(self, / , sep=None, maxsplit=-1)` is a *string method* with two\n    optional (defaulted) arguments - it returns list of words in the\n    string using `sep` as the delimiter, at most `maxsplit` splits are done:\n    elements (note the implicit arguments):\n    \n        print('1,2,3'.split(','))  # default maxsplit = -1 means no limit\n        print('1,2,3'.split(',',0)) # don't split\n        print('1,2,3'.split(',',1)) # split once\n        print('1,2,3'.split(',',2)) # split twice\n        print('1,2,3'.split(',',3)) # split thrice - nothing more to do\n\n-   The dot-operator `.` is an *accessor*: it allows you to access anything\n    that's stored inside an object, e.g. the *string* class `str`, or an\n    instance of that class, a particular string.\n\n-   What happens when the string to be split does not have substrings?\n    \n        a, b = 'Marcus'.split()\n        print(a,b)\n\n-   Why?\n    \n        help(str.split)\n\n-   What does the `/` refer to in the `str.split` docstring:\n    \n        str.split(self, /, sep=None, maxsplit=-1)\n    \n    The `/` is a *parameter separator*: it denotes the end of\n    positional-only parameters. After `self` (the string itself), the\n    parameters `sep` and `maxsplit` can be explicitly assigned:\n    \n        print(str.split('Marcus Birkenkrahe'))\n        print(str.split('Marcus_Birkenkrahe','_'))\n        print(str.split('Marcus_Birkenkrahe',sep='_'))\n        print('Marcus_Birkenkrahe'.split(sep='_'))\n        print('Marcus_Birkenkrahe'.split('_'))\n\n"
