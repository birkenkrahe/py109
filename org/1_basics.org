* Python Basics

To write handy little programs that automate 'boring' tasks, you only
need some basics:
1) expressions ~2 + 2~
2) data types like ~integer~
3) variables like ~spam~
4) statements like ~spam = 1~
5) debugging dealing with errors like ~NameError~

The code is available as [[https://gist.github.com/birkenkrahe/445237c66cb015ca243c3c5fe40f9888][GitHub gist]] and in the ~ipynb~ [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/py109/tree/main/ipynb][in GitHub]].

* Expressions: values and operators ([[https://gist.github.com/birkenkrahe/6fc1fca1e9021e0837175d41972bcb29][gist]])

Enter the classic formula ~2 + 2~ at the prompt and press ~RET~ (Enter)
to (hopefully) get the classic answer ~4~.
#+begin_src python
  print(2+2)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 4

~2 + 2~ is called an /expression/, a basic programming instruction.

An expression consist of /values/ (such as ~2~) in computer memory, and
/operators/ (such as the binary operator ~+~), which are /functions/.

Expressions can always /evaluate/ i.e. reduce to a single value - so
you can e.g. use ~2+2~ anywhere instead of ~4~ because you know it's
going to be reduced to ~4~.

Examples:
1) use ~2+2~ as the /argument/ of a ~print~ function.
2) use ~2+2~ as the argument of a ~str~ function.
3) look at the help for ~print~
4) look at the help for ~str~
#+begin_src python
  print(2+2)
  print(str(2+2))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 4
: 4

A single value like ~2~ is also an expression (it doesn't express
anything else but itself) and evaluates to itself.

* Error messages

When Python cannot evaluate an expression, it "throws" an
error. Here is [[http://inventwithpython.com/appendixd.html][list of common error messages]] in Python with a plain
English explanation (Sweigart, 2019).

Let's create a couple of error messages using wrong expressions:
1) Enter ~2 +~
2) Enter ~2 + '2'~
3) Enter ~2~ and then on the next line enter ~2~ again
4) Enter ~2~ then ~\~ and then on the next line ~2~ again
5) Enter ~2 + ++ 2~ then change the first ~+~ to a ~-~
#+begin_src python

#+end_src

* Operators

The table shows a list of all math operators in Python. They are
listed from highest to lowest precedence:

![img]("file")

The precedence is the order of operations: when Python gets an
expression with more than one operator, it evaluates from left to
right (you can force execution with parentheses).

For example, the expression ~-2+24/8~ is evaluated as ~1~ and not as ~2.75~
because ~(24/8)=3~ and ~3-2=1~:
1) Enter ~-2 + 24 / 8~
2) Enter ~(-2 + 24) / 8~
#+begin_src python

#+end_src

So-called "whitespace" (empty space) between symbols does not
matter, so ~24/8~ is evaluated identically to ~24 / 8~.

Enter the following expressions into the interactive shell:
#+begin_example python
2 + 3 * 6
(2 + 3) * 6
48565857 * 578453
2 ** 8
23 / 7
23 // 7
2      +     2
(5 - 1) * ((7 + 1 ) / (3 - 1))
#+end_example

You can see the result in ~py_ops_example.png~.
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Expressions in the interactive Python shell (in Emacs)
[[../img/py_ops_example.png]]

This diagram shows how Python ruthlessly evaluates parts of the
expression until it has reached a single value: ~py_ops_example1.png~.
#+attr_latex: :width 250px
#+caption: Evaluation of composite expression to a single value
[[../img/py_ops_example1.png]]

* Variables

A data type is a category for values: every value belongs to exactly
one data type.

Variables in Python do not need to be declared but they are
dynamically typed, i.e. at runtime.

Common data types are listed in this table: ~1_data_types.png~ - insert
it here:
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Common data types (Source: Sweigart, 2019)
[[../img/1_data_types.png]]

Python's names for these data types are:
- ~int~ for integer numbers,
- ~float~ for floating point numbers,
- ~str~ for strings.

The ~type~ function reveals a value's or a variable's data type: check
the type of ~-2~, ~2~, ~1.25~, ~'a'~, ~'name'~, ~a~.
#+begin_example python
  type(-2)
  type(2)
  type(1.25)
  type('a')
  type('name')
  type(a)
#+end_example

Why does ~type(a)~ give a "Name Error"? Answer: Because Python expects a
variable named ~a~, which is not defined.

* String concatenation and replication

The meaning of an operator may change based on the data types of its
operands.

Enter the following examples in separate code cells (otherwise you
only get the last result - or you have to add ~print~). Create a new
code cell after the current cell by typing ~b~.

Examples:
1) ~'Alice' + 'Bob'~
2) ~'Alice' + 42~
#+begin_src python
  print('Alice' + 'Bob')
  print('Alice' + 42)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: AliceBob

Python can only concatenate numbers or strings. You have to
explicitly convert the 2nd argument to a string:
1) ~'Alice' + str(42)~
2) ~'Alice' + str(Bob)~
#+begin_src python

#+end_src

Unless ~Bob~ is initialized as an integer, this will not work:
1) ~Bob = 42~
2) ~'Alice' + str(Bob)~
#+begin_src python

#+end_src

The ~*~ operator can be used with one string and one integer value for
replication:
1) ~'Alice' * 'Bob'~
2) ~'Alice' * 5.0~
3) ~'Alice' * 5~
4) ~'Alice' * int(5.0)~
#+begin_src python

#+end_src

* Assignments: storing values in variables

A /variable/ is like a box in the computer's memory where you can
store a single value.

You store values in variables with an ~assignment statement~,
consisting of: a variable name, the ~=~ operator, and the value.

A variable is initialized or created the first time a value is
stored in it.

When a variable is assigned a new value, the old value is forgotten.

For variables and flow control visualization, the site
~pythontutor.com~ is particularly valuable.
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: pythontutor.com home page
[[../img/py_pythontutor.png]]

To visualize this, open ~pythontutor.com~ and enter this code:
#+begin_example python
  spam = 40
  eggs = 2
  spam + eggs
  spam + eggs + spam
  spam = spam + eggs
  print(spam)
#+end_example

Similarly for strings:
#+begin_example python
  spam = 'Hello'
  print(spam)
  spam = 'Goodbye'
  print(spam)
#+end_example

* Variable names

Insert the table ~py_variable_names.png~ for example of valid and invalid
variable names.
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/py_variable_names.png]]

You can name a variable anything as long as it obeys these rules:
1. It can be only one word with no spaces
2. It can only use letters, numbers and the underscore character (~_~)
3. It can't begin with a number

You should not use Python keywords, symbols, function or module
names as your variables (though you may be allowed to).

Variables in Python are case-sensitive.

Some people prefer camel-case for variable names instead of
underscores: ~helloWorld~ instead of ~hello_world~. Either is OK.

* Warming up: spooky season
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: "spooky" by Tony Coates (flickr.com)
[[../img/spooky.jpg]]

Problem: print "spooky" with 2 to 20 vowels ([[https://gist.github.com/birkenkrahe/3c4487280dbfaa10963be8a598a4ad53][solution]]).

*Let's do it together* - open a new notebook ~spooky.ipynb~ for:
1. solution flow (from input to output)
2. variables (storing values)
3. functions and operators (doing stuff)
4. implementation (coding)
5. testing (debugging)
6. production (submission)

* Understanding standard data streams

We want to write a program that
1) Says 'Hello world!'
2) Asks for your name
3) Greets you with your name
4) Tells you how many characters your name has
5) Asks for your age
6) Tells you how old you're going to be in one year

We're going to use this command sequence to learn a few functions
useful to get input from the keyboard and manipulate text.

Check the ~help~ for ~input~ in the Python reference manual, or in the
notebook, enter ~?input~ to get the /docstring/ for the function.
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Python help for keyboard input() function
[[../img/input.png]]

What does this mean?
1. ~input~ reads a string from the keyboard or from a file (/stdin/)
2. If ~input()~ is used, the default ~prompt~ is missing (~None~)
3. If a prompt is used, it is printed without newline (/stdout/)
4. If CTRL-D (End Of File) is hit, an ~EOFError~ is raised.

Standard input, output and error are the three data streams:
/[insert image ~streams.png~ here]/
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: stdin, stdout, stderr for two shell commands
[[../img/streams.png]]

Their standard direction is the screen but they can be redirected
anywhere, e.g. into files:
#+begin_example sh
  rm hello 2&>/dev/null
  echo "Hello, world" > hello
  cat hello
#+end_example

* Getting input from the keyboard

Step 1: Ask for user's ~name~ and print out the number of characters
in the name:
#+name: step_1
#+begin_src python :tangle ../src/step1.py
  print('hello world')
  name = input('What is your name?' )
  print('Good to meet you,' + name)
  print('Your name has', len(name), 'characters')
#+end_src

Why did we not use the ~+~ operator in the last line? Try it.

Step 2: ask for user's age and print out age one year from now:
#+name: step_2
#+begin_src python :tangle ../src/step2.py
  print('What is your age?')
  age = input()
  print('You are going to be ' + str(int(age) + 1) + ' years old')
#+end_src

* Python script infrastructure

Not to forget about the Python script infrastructure:
1) You can save the Python code of your notebook as ~.py~ file
2) You can run the script on the terminal using Jupyter lab.

* Getting keyboard input with a prompt

To save code, let's use the ability of ~input~ to display a ~prompt~ (as
shown in the docstring with ~?input~:
1) Put both programs in one code cell.
2) Use ~input~ to ask for the ~name~ and the ~age~.
3) Print greeting with ~name~, length of ~name~.
4) Print ~age~ next year.
5) Sample run (terminal):
   #+attr_latex: :width 400px
   #+caption: Testing input with prompt
   [[../img/prompt.png]]

#+begin_src python

#+end_src

Step 3: getting ~input~ with ~prompt~:
#+name: step_3
#+begin_src python :tangle ../src/prompt.py
  print("Hello world!")
  name = input("What is your name? ")
  print("Good to meet you, " + name)
  print("Your name has ", len(name), " characters")
  age = input("What is your age? ")
  print("You're going to be " + str(int(age) + 1) + " years old")
#+end_src

* Getting two input values at once

Step 4: getting two input values at once with ~split~:
#+name: step_4
#+begin_src python :tangle ../src/split.py
  print("Hello world!")
  input_data = input("Enter name and age separated by a space: ")
  name, age = input_data.split()
  print("Good to meet you, " + name)
  print("Your name has ", len(name), " characters")
  print("You're going to be " + str(int(age) + 1) + " years old")
#+end_src

Check out the docstring of this new function with: ~split?~.
#+begin_quote
- ~split~ is a string method - outside of ~str~ it has no meaning.
- You have to look for ~str.split?~ to get the docstring.
- Notice that ~str.split()?~ or ~help(str.split())~ throw errors.
#+end_quote

* Function preview

Functions in your code are like mini programs. We called six
functions: ~print~, ~input~, ~len~, ~int~, ~str~, ~split~:
1) ~print~ prints its arguments but can also evaluate:
   #+begin_src python
     print("Hi")
     print(5 + 5)
   #+end_src
2) ~input~ takes input from the keyboard or from the command line
   (input stream ~stdin~) and either prints it or
   lets you assign it to a variable (output stream ~stdout~):
   #+begin_example python
     input("What's your name? ") # prints and waits for input
   #+end_example
3) ~len~ computes the length of its (string) argument and returns an
   integer:
   #+begin_src python
     print(len("Birkenkrahe"))
     var = 'Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän'
     print(len(var))  # with the len() function
     print(var.__len__())  # with the str.__len__ method
   #+end_src
4) ~str~ returns its value as a string:
   #+begin_src python
     print(str(1000) + " random numbers")
     print(str('1000') + " random numbers")
   #+end_src
5) ~split~ returns a ~list~ of words that can be split up among
   different variables:
   #+begin_src python
     name = "Marcus 2  Birkenkrahe"
     print(name.split()) # default: split on whitespace, ignore ' '
     first, last = name.split()  # split name in two parts
     print(first,last)
     print(first + last)
   #+end_src
* SOMEDAY A few open questions

- What does the expression ~str(int(age) + 1)~ do?
  1) ~age~ is string ~input~
  2) ~int(age)~ converts the string to a number - you cannot do that
     with any character like "a": ~int("a")~ throws an error. To convert
     characters to their Unicode standard, you need to use ~ord~:
     #+begin_src python
       print(int("25"))
       print(ord("a"))
       print(ord("A"))
     #+end_src
  3) ~int(age) + 1~ adds 1 to whatever number ~int(age)~ evaluates to:
     #+begin_src python
       age = "25"
       print(age)
       print(age + " years old")
       print(int(age))
       print(int(age)+1)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 25
     : 25 years old
     : 25
     : 26
  4) ~str(int(age) + 1)~ converts the result to a string:
     #+begin_src python
       age = "25"
       print(age)
       print(age + " years old")
       print(int(age))
       print(int(age)+1)
       print(str(int(age)+1))
       print(str(int(age)+1) + " years old")
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 25
     : 25 years old
     : 25
     : 26
     : 26
     : 26 years old

- [[https://automatetheboringstuff.com/eval/3-4.html][Here is an HTML animation to illustrate these steps]] (Sweigart, 2023)

- ~split(self, / , sep=None, maxsplit=-1)~ is a /string method/ with two
  optional (defaulted) arguments - it returns list of words in the
  string using ~sep~ as the delimiter, at most ~maxsplit~ splits are done:
  elements (note the implicit arguments):
  #+begin_src python
    print('1,2,3'.split(','))  # default maxsplit = -1 means no limit
    print('1,2,3'.split(',',0)) # don't split
    print('1,2,3'.split(',',1)) # split once
    print('1,2,3'.split(',',2)) # split twice
    print('1,2,3'.split(',',3)) # split thrice - nothing more to do
  #+end_src

- The dot-operator ~.~ is an /accessor/: it allows you to access anything
  that's stored inside an object, e.g. the /string/ class ~str~, or an
  instance of that class, a particular string.

- What happens when the string to be split does not have substrings?
  #+begin_src python :results output
    a, b = 'Marcus'.split()
    print(a,b)
  #+end_src

- Why?
  #+begin_src python :results output
    help(str.split)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  Help on method_descriptor:

  split(self, /, sep=None, maxsplit=-1)
      Return a list of the substrings in the string, using sep as the separator string.

        sep
          The separator used to split the string.

          When set to None (the default value), will split on any whitespace
          character (including \\n \\r \\t \\f and spaces) and will discard
          empty strings from the result.
        maxsplit
          Maximum number of splits (starting from the left).
          -1 (the default value) means no limit.

      Note, str.split() is mainly useful for data that has been intentionally
      delimited.  With natural text that includes punctuation, consider using
      the regular expression module.
  #+end_example

- What does the ~/~ refer to in the ~str.split~ docstring:
  #+begin_example
    str.split(self, /, sep=None, maxsplit=-1)
  #+end_example
  The ~/~ is a /parameter separator/: it denotes the end of
  positional-only parameters. After ~self~ (the string itself), the
  parameters ~sep~ and ~maxsplit~ can be explicitly assigned:
  #+begin_src python :results output
    print(str.split('Marcus Birkenkrahe'))
    print(str.split('Marcus_Birkenkrahe','_'))
    print(str.split('Marcus_Birkenkrahe',sep='_'))
    print('Marcus_Birkenkrahe'.split(sep='_'))
    print('Marcus_Birkenkrahe'.split('_'))
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : ['Marcus', 'Birkenkrahe']
  : ['Marcus', 'Birkenkrahe']
  : ['Marcus', 'Birkenkrahe']
  : ['Marcus', 'Birkenkrahe']
  : ['Marcus', 'Birkenkrahe']

* Summary

- An instruction that evaluates to a single value is an
  *expression*. An instruction that doesn't is a *statement*.
- Data types are: integer (~int~), floating-point (~float~), string (~str~)
- Strings hold text and begin and end with quotes: ~‘Hello world!'~
- Strings can be concatenated (~+~) and replicated (~*~)
- Values can be stored in variables: ~spam = 42~
- Variables can be used anywhere where values can be used in
  expressions: ~spam + 1~
- Variable names: one word, letters, numbers (not at beginning),
  underscore only
- Comments begin with a # character and are ignored by Python; they
  are notes & reminders for the programmer.
- Functions are like mini-programs in your program.
- The ~print~ function displays the value passed to it.
- The ~input~ function lets users type in a value.
- The ~len~ function takes a string value and returns an integer value
  of the string's length.
- The ~int~, ~str~, and ~float~ functions can be used to convert data.
