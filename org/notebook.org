- R vs. Python: two dominant data science languages ([[https://www.datacamp.com/blog/python-vs-r-for-data-science-whats-the-difference?irclickid=0a2UQaStbxyNWhXRYE2FCwsmUkF3qu3eNVpDxo0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact&utm_campaign=000000_1-1310690_2-mix_3-all_4-na_5-na_6-na_7-mp_8-affl-ip_9-na_10-bau_11-Admitad%20-%201310690&utm_content=TEXT_LINK&utm_term=442763][more on the DataCamp blog]])
- OOP = Object-Oriented Programming. [[https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-paradigms/object-oriented-programming?ex=1][See DataCamp course chapter]].
- TIOBE: software quality control, also ranking site based on searches
  ([[https://tiobe.com/index][tiobe.com/index]]). Little change among the top 10 languages. "TIOBE"
  stands for "The Importance Of Being Earnest" ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest][play by Oscar Wilde]]).
- HTML = HyperText Markup Language. Not a programming language at all,
  but a language of meta data for layout. ([[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search?query=HTML][learn it @freeCodeCamp]]).
- C++ is a superset of C, i.e. C is fully contained within C++
  (more on C vs. C++ [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/c-vs-cpp-whats-the-difference/][@freeCodeCamp]]).
- Scrum: agile project management method originating from software
  engineering and now used much elsewhere ([[https://youtu.be/SWDhGSZNF9M][Scrum in 20 min - video]]).

- Opened DataCamp workspace to a sample notebook
  at tinyurl.com/WorkspaceDemoPython
- Workspace has sample data, code along webinars. It runs on a virtual
  Linux server (16GB RAM and 8 vCPUs).
- Interactive notebooks are much easier to use than files because
  documentation, code and output are all integrated already.
- These are the steps that we save when using workspace: 1) Opening
  Jupyter Lab launcher; 2) Opening a file editor for our first Python
  file ("hello world"); 3) saving the file with the ending .py; 4)
  opening a terminal and finding the file; 5) executing the file with
  the ~python3~ command.
- CSV files (.csv) are comma-separated-value files i.e. individual
  values for the cells of a table are separated by a comma.

- "Dynamically typed" languages take care of memory management for
  data types (e.g. integer, floating point, character).
- "Cheat sheets" are collections of useful commands.
- Python libraries (like ~pandas~) contain useful functions that you can
  use in your code if you link (aka ~import~) the library first.
- ~pandas~ is a library for the manipulation of tabular data (called
  data frames). It is usually imported as the alias ~pd~.
- The interactive notebook (aka workspace) contains text cells and
  code cells. Text cells can be edited, code cells can be run. The
  output appears below the code cell.
