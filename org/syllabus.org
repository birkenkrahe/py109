* Objectives

Students will learn how to install Python and an IDE, and get started
with basic data types, control flow statements, functions, files, and
exceptions. They will also gain hands-on experience with more advanced
topics such as object-oriented programming, modules and packages,
testing and debugging, and data analysis and visualization.

Throughout the course, students will have ample opportunity to
practice their programming skills with a variety of exercises and
projects using the Google Colaboratory and DataCamp platforms. They
will also receive guidance and feedback from the instructor on their
progress and final projects.

By the end of the course, students should have a solid foundation in
Python programming and be able to apply their skills to a wide range
of projects, from game development to process automation, data
analysis and visualization. This course is ideal for anyone with
little or no programming experience who wants to learn Python or for
those who have some experience in programming and want to learn more
advanced concepts and practical applications.

* Course requirements

- Formal prerequisite MTH 101 (College Algebra)
- No prior knowledge required
- Curiosity is essential
- Experience with computers is useful but not critical

* Grading system

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.
