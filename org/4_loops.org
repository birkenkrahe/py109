- Loops are clauses that repeat any number of times.

- Like all clauses, a condition is tested to check if the clause ought
  to be entered.

- But once it's been entered, the condition is tested again after
  performing some action:
  #+begin_example python
     loop [condition]:
        do something
        go back to the loop condition
  #+end_example

- Python knows two loop types, ~while~ and ~for~, and two loop exit
  strategies, ~break~ and ~continue~.

* While loops

- A ~while~ statement always consists of:
  1) The ~while~ keyword
  2) A condition (an expression that evaluates to ~True~ or ~False~)
  3) A colon (~:~)
  4) An indented block (~while~ clause) on the next line.

- At the end of an ~if~ statement, execution continues. At the end of a
  ~while~ statement, execution jumps back to test the condition again.

- Here is an ~if~ statement to print 'Hello, world.'
  #+begin_src python
    spam = 0
    if spam < 5:
        print('Hello, world.')
        spam = spam + 1
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello, world.

- Replacing ~if~ by ~while~: when executed, this prints 'Hello, world.'
  five times.
  #+begin_src python
    spam = 0
    while spam < 5:
        print('Hello, world.')
        spam = spam + 1
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello, world.
  : Hello, world.
  : Hello, world.
  : Hello, world.
  : Hello, world.

- Look at the BPMN process diagrams and the code side by side ([[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B1eSv3pfQOCOoVl5dpuX6OcXsyXXPyvgAxUryBkGPL0/edit?usp=sharing][slide]]):
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: if vs. while statement
  [[../img/py_if_while_full.png]]

- In the ~while~ statement, the condition is checked at the start of
  each /iteration/ (that is one loop execution).

- Production BPMN diagrams with loops do not have any lines running
  back: instead, the loop tasks are overloaded as shown here. To save
  time, we're not using a production BPMN tool (like signavio.com) but
  a simpler, free online tool like bpmn.io.
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px

* Annoying while it lasts

- Create a new code block (or a new notebook) in Colab and enter the
  following code, replacing ~'your name'~ by your actual name:
  + collapse the print + input lines into one input + prompt line!
  #+begin_src python :tangle ./src/yourName.py
    name = ''
    while name != 'your name':
        print('Please type your name')
        name = input()
    print('Thank you!')
  #+end_src

- Run the file and try to understand what's going on:
  1) The ~name~ variable is initialized as the empty string ~''~
  2) The condition is tested for the first time: it's ~True~
  3) The clause is entered and you're asked to enter your name
  4) The ~input~ function assigns what you entered to ~name~
  5) The condition is tested again (and again and again...)
  6) As soon as you enter your name, with the correct spelling, the
     condition becomes ~False~ and the program jumps to the last line.

- Go to [[https://autbor.com/yourname/][autbor.com/yourname/]] to run the file. ~Edit this code~ to change
  ~'your name'~ in the code to your own name.

- Here is the process diagram for this code:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: While loop that waits until you enter your name
  [[../img/py_yourname.png]]

* Breaking out of a loop

- Loops are entered when the condition evaluates to ~True~ and they are
  left only if it evaluates to ~False~ - it's easy to go "infinite".

- When execution hits the ~break~ statement, it exits the current clause
  immediately. In nested loops, it exits the innermost loop only.

- Let's create an infinite loop and ~break~ it when a condition is met:
  #+begin_src python
    while True:
        name = input('Please type your name: ')
        if name == 'your name':
            break
    print('Thank you!')
  #+end_src

- Go to [[https://autbor.com/yourname2/][autbor.com/yourname2/]] to run the file. ~Edit this code~ to
  change ~'your name'~ in the code to your own name.

- Here is the process diagram for this and the previous loop:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: Infinite while loop that must be broken out of
  [[../img/py_yourname2.png]]
  [[../img/py_yourname.png]]

- *Exercise:* what happens if you use ~break~ outside of a loop clause?
  Can you fool Python by indenting the ~break~? Write a one-line "Hello,
  world!" program followed by a ~break~ statement:
  #+begin_src python
    print("Hello, world!")
    break
  #+end_src

- For fun, create an infinite loop /without/ break condition that prints
  "Infinity!" forever until you break the execution with CTRL-D:
  #+begin_example python
    while True:
        print('Infinity')
  #+end_example

- In Colab, delete the "infinite" output by clicking on the "X".  

* Continuing a loop

- Like ~break~, the ~continue~ statement is only used inside a loop.

- When a ~continue~ statement is reached, the program jumps back to the
  start of the loop and re-evaluates the loop condition.

- Write a program that:
  1) starts with an infinite ~while~ loop (always ~True~)
  2) asks for ~input~ of a ~name~.
  3) ~if~ the ~name~ is not equal to ~'Joe'~ it executes ~continue~
  4) otherwise, it asks for ~input~ of the ~password~
  5) ~if~ the ~password~ is ~'swordfish'~ it executes ~break~.
  6) confirms ~'Access granted'~ when you're done.

- Solution:
  #+begin_src python :tangle ../src/swordfish.py
    while True:
        name = input("Who are you? ")
        if name != 'Joe':
            continue
        password = input("What's the password? ")
        if password == 'swordfish':
            break
    print('Access granted')
  #+end_src

- Copy the code, open pythontutor.com and paste the program code.

- Run the program inside the pythontutor.com visualization tool.

- The BPMN diagram shows the two break points clearly:

* Non-Boolean truth values

- Recall: to the computer, when used in conditions, ~0~, ~0.0~ and ~''~
  (empty string) are ~False~, while all other values are ~True~.

- What does the following program do?
  #+begin_src python :tangle ./src/guest1.py
    name = ''
    while not name:    # until you enter a name!
        name = input('Enter your name: ')
        guests = input('How many guests will you have? ')
    if int(guests):    # if you have non-zero guests
        print('Make sure to have enough room')
    print('Done')
  #+end_src

- Try it in pythontutor: [[https://autbor.com/howmanyguests/][autbor.com/howmanyguests/]]

- You could have entered ~while not name != ''~ instead of ~while not
  name~ and you could have used ~if guests != 0~ instead of ~if guests~

- The BPMN diagram:
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: Non-Boolean truth values
  [[../img/py_yourguests.png]]

- If you enter ~''~ in response to the second question (number of
  ~guests~), an error is generated, because ~int~ cannot convert empty
  space or whitespace to an integer. To fix this, you must handle it
  as an /exception/:
  #+begin_src python :tangle ./src/guest2.py
    name, guests = '',''
    while not name:
        name = input('Enter your name: ')
        guests = input('How many guests will you have? ')
    if guests == '':
        guests = 0
        print('okay')
    if int(guests):
        print('Make sure to have enough room')
        print('Done')
  #+end_src

* For loops

- The ~for~ statement allows you to repeat a block of code a certain
  number of times.

- A ~for~ statement includes:
  1) the ~for~ keyword
  2) a loop variable
  3) a call to the ~range~ function with up to 3 integers
  4) a colon ~:~
  5) An indented clause starting on the next line

- Simple example: the program ~fiveTimes.py~ executes the statement in
  its clause five times while ~i~ is counting up from 0 to 4:
  #+begin_src python :results output :tangle ./src/fiveTimes.py
    print('My name is')
    for i in range(5):
        print('Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')')
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : My name is
  : Jimmy Five Times (0)
  : Jimmy Five Times (1)
  : Jimmy Five Times (2)
  : Jimmy Five Times (3)
  : Jimmy Five Times (4)
  
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: For loop with range 5
  [[../img/py_for.png]]

- Challenge: how would the ~print~ statement look like with an f-string?

- Solution:  
  #+begin_src python :tangle ./src/ffiveTimes.py
    print('My name is')
    for i in range(5):
        print(f'Jimmy Five Times ({i})')
  #+end_src
  
- ~for~ loops are great for counting up and down in regular in- or
  decrements. This program adds up all numbers from 1 to 100 and
  stores the result in ~total~:
  #+begin_src python
    total = 0
    for i in range(101):
        total = total + i
    print(total)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 5050

- This last result relates to a story: when the mathematician Carl
  Friedrich Gauss was a boy, he found a way to add up all the numbers
  from 0 to 100. He noticed that there are 50 pairs of numbers that
  add up to 101: 1 + 100, 2 + 99,...,50 + 51, and 50 * 101 = 5,050.

- Check this program [[https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=total%20%3D%200%0Afor%20i%20in%20range%28101%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20total%20%3D%20total%20%2B%20i%0Aprint%28total%29%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false][in pythontutor.com]].

* Equivalence of while and for

- ~for~ loops and ~while~ loops are fully equivalent but the former are
  more concise than the latter.

- *Exercise*: rewrite ~fiveTimes.py~ as ~fiveTimes2.py~ with a ~while~ loop
  instead of a ~for~ loop.

- Solution:
  #+begin_src python :tangle ./src/fiveTimes2.py
    print('My name is')
    i = 0
    while i < 5:
        print('Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')')
        i = i + 1
  #+end_src

- Once you're done, run the program at [[https://autbor.com/fivetimeswhile/][pythontutor.com]].

* Starting, stopping and stepping with ~range~

- The shortest documentation can be had on the IPython shell with the
  keyword (variable or function) ~?~

- The ~range~ function ('constructor') e.g. is documented online in the
  [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=range#range][Python standard library]]:
  1) All parameters must be integers only, keywords are not allowed
  2) Only the ~stop~ parameter is mandatory: ~range(5)~
  3) The other paramaters: ~range(start, stop[, step])~ with defaults
     ~start=0~ and ~step=1~.

- For example, ~range(12,16)~ starts at 12 and stops at 16:
  #+begin_src python
    for i in range(12,16):
        print(i)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 12
  : 13
  : 14
  : 15

- Counting up from 2 in steps of 2:
  #+begin_src python
    for i in range(2,10,2):
        print(i)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 2
  : 4
  : 6
  : 8

- You can use a negative number for ~step~ to make the loop count down:
  #+begin_src python
    for i in range(5,-1,-1):
        print(i)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 5
  : 4
  : 3
  : 2
  : 1
  : 0

- What ~type~ is ~range(5)~?
  #+begin_src python :results output
    print(type(range(5))
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

* Summary

- Code can be executed repeatedly in a loop while their conditions
  evaluate to ~True~ using ~while~ or ~for~.

- The ~range~ function constructs a sequence of integers. Its parameters
  are ~start~, ~stop~ and ~step~ values, with default ~start=0~, ~step=1~.

- ~break~, ~continue~ and ~sys.exit~ can exit a loop, jump back to the
  start, or terminate the execution.
